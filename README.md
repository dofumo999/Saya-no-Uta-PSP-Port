FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSE!!



The game might crash and stop running. ( Happens when after the what saya and fumiori do to yoh)

HOW TO FIX:

1: go in game files and select the "o.txt" file

2: go down until u find the line u were at before the game crashes

3: now delete the line that doesn't show up, for me it was (csp 0- print 1- dwave 1 ,"voice\28\013800.ogg"-name"fumiori"-"says--just what are u?")

4: close

5: run game
